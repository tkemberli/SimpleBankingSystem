# SimpleBankingSystem

This is a very simple banking system for DIO's Bootcamp exercise. It should simulate a bank, where you can make deposits, transfers, withdraws and see the statement of accounts.

What I did differently:

- Used Project Lombok
- Gave the transaction responsibility to a controller

I had to stop the exercise abruptelly, since I was getting Ideas on how to implement security and a front-end; this is suposed to be a very simple terminal application.
